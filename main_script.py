"""
Economist Application Pt. 1 -- Cameron Ferwerda

Problem Statement:

Your script should output two CSVs, called polls.csv and trends.csv (for the averages). The polls file should have columns for 
date, pollster, n (sample size), and each candidate (by name); the trends file just date and a column for each candidate. Values 
for polls and trends should be a number from 0 to 1. The polls file should have a row for each poll. The trends file should 
have a row for each day, starting with October 11th, 2023.

Ideally it will have tests or some sort of error monitoring, and will detect or alert us in the event of a major error. 
(Writing errors to a log file is a sufficient alert for this assignment.) Your entire program should be executable from 
a single command, but it probably shouldnâ€™t be written in a single monolithic script.
